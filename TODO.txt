1. Replan & Cleanup todo
2. 

CHORUS => KORUS

- Deploy to the same gogoel cloud project, (and rename it)
  so that postgres access is auto-handled.

NEXT:
- fix known bugs

idea:
refresh 
- spotify add to playlist  ( select playlist to go to? )
- name of person you got the song from (scope out the need for it, tech maybe weird for it if multiple share)

urgent bugs
- ADD TO PLAYLIST IN APPLE MUSIC
- DOESNT GO TO LIKED TAB RIGHT AWAY
- SHARE LIST DOESNT WORK WELL

mild bugs
- case when SPOTIFY doesn't play
    => not connected -> connecting
        & song playing already on Spotify



- Better analytics ( what streaming service are they using? maybe that's a user property? etc )

TODO tags
* TODO OPENBETA - 


TODAY
- Performance & scalability
    - SQLification 
    - https://sequelize.org/v5/

- update npm, pods & Cleanup & React native upgrade

Cross-Platform Remaining
- Spotify access token refresh
- REACT HOOKS issue... 
        happened after refresh feed after a change to feed. due to /migrate
- Could be improved by more involved linkage algorithm (esp diff album, same song)
- Cronjob needed?
- Better code isolation
    - Should have a cross-platform lookup service (SHARE / MIGRATE integrated)

Maintenance
- api fails in production mode
    - performance is probably better in prod mode

- React native typescript
    https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript

- SQLification 
    https://sequelize.org/v5/

- AirBnb no like me research

User Engagement
    - Push notifications (andrew)
    - Listen in-app (alex)
        - Jamie idea: should be always-up-to-date, good music (don't like a queue system, should be cyclical)

Existing functionality enhancement
    Apple Music weirdnesses
        - Of course securiy, storage of tokens and stuff
        - Storefronts. Should there be a default (ca/us), or fallbacks
        esp. for isrc resolution? Hardcoding CA or maybe US in some places rn
        - Rate limiting
        - Caching

    Spotify
        - access token, refresh token storage?
        - Rate limiting
        - Caching

SECURITY / USER INPUT VALIDATION
- Firebase/nodejs
- any other user input or action. (req.*)
- per-user quotas

Sharing experience
    - Preview song you share
    - Show existing music in there
