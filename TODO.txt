# Next
1. Specification for push notifications
    - particularly right now user engagement is a focus - can template notifications, like “{user} shared {songName} by {songArtist}”
- Love screen (track the songs you loved so you can  add to play list ? )
(loved) evolving playlist (loved)

PRIORITIZATION!!!!
HIGHEST.
    Start with why.
- Profile screen : plan. frontend, backend, stats, refactorings.
- DIAGRAMS!!

    // - api fails in production mode

LOWEST

- Performance improvements
- Rate limiting and other misc things like caching for spotify/appmusic web appmusic
   - read old technical design doc
- Put calculation into command, not query   
- Like right away... aggregate events into local storage then push?
- React optimizations improvements (ComponentWillUpdate, read logs)

Security / input validation analysis
- Firebase/nodejs
- any other user input or action.

Major

- Spotify integration
    Remaining:
      - Cross-platform needed
        Background job?

- Groups
    - Only valuable once we get more users.

- Chorus playlists

- Profile
  Songs I shared
  Songs I love

Intermediary

Lowish priority 

- Share - preview song you share

High-ish priority

- Share - show existing music in there
    1. songs i liked
    2. songs i played recently
    3. playlist
    4. rest

    Search still searches apple music
    Possibly prioritize library then applemusic
