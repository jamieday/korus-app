- Find out who liked your song

arseny apple music some songs dont play

AppleMusic
- Playback experience
- Apple Music top songs integrated
- Firebase access token refresh


1. Replan & Cleanup todo


NEXT:
- fix known bugs

idea:
refresh 
- spotify add to playlist  ( select playlist to go to? )
- name of person you got the song from (scope out the need for it, tech maybe weird for it if multiple share)
- Better analytics ( what streaming service are they using? maybe that's a user property? etc )

TODAY
- update npm, pods

Cross-Platform Remaining
- Spotify access token refresh
- Could be improved by more involved linkage algorithm (esp diff album, same song)
- Cronjob needed?
- Better code isolation
    - Should have a cross-platform lookup service (SHARE / MIGRATE integrated)

Maintenance
- React native typescript
    https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript

# Next
User Engagement
    - Listen in-app (alex)
        - Jamie idea: should be always-up-to-date, good music (don't like a queue system, should be cyclical)

Existing functionality enhancement
    Apple Music weirdnesses
        - Of course securiy, storage of tokens and stuff
        - Storefronts. Should there be a default (ca/us), or fallbacks
        esp. for isrc resolution? Hardcoding CA or maybe US in some places rn
        - Rate limiting
        - Caching

    Spotify
        - access token, refresh token storage?
        - Rate limiting
        - Caching

    Elasticsearch
        - The share list is too slow for scale

SECURITY / USER INPUT VALIDATION
- Firebase/nodejs
- any other user input or action. (req.*)
- per-user quotas
- The 0.0.0.0 for postgres

Sharing experience
    - Preview song you share
    - Show existing music in there
