NOW
- Performance
- SHOW songs you can't play.

TODAY
- SPOTIFY / APPLE MUSIC CROSS-PLATFORM
    - Should have a cross-platform lookup service (SHARE / MIGRATE integrated)
- (usability) NEW SEARCH => drives shares
- (user engagement) ACTIVITY => drives listens
- Performance
- Cleanup & React native upgrade
- SQLification 
- https://sequelize.org/v5/

TOMORROW
- update npm, pods

Cross-Platform Quality
- Could be improved by more involved linkage algorithm (esp diff album, same song)
- 


# Next
1. Specification for push notifications
    - particularly right now user engagement is a focus - can template notifications, like “{user} shared {songName} by {songArtist}”
- Love screen (track the songs you loved so you can  add to play list ? )
(loved) evolving playlist (loved)

PRIORITIZATION!!!!

    Start with why.
- Profile screen : plan. frontend, backend, stats, refactorings.
- DIAGRAMS!!

    // - api fails in production mode


APple Music weirdnesses
- Of course securiy, storage of tokens and stuff
- Storefronts. Should there be a default (ca/us), or fallbacks
  esp. for isrc resolution? Hardcoding CA or maybe US in some places rn

Spotify
- access token, refresh token storage?

LOWEST

- Performance improvements
- Rate limiting and other misc things like caching for spotify/appmusic web appmusic
   - read old technical design doc
- Put calculation into command, not query   
- Like right away... aggregate events into local storage then push?
- React optimizations improvements (ComponentWillUpdate, read logs)

Security / input validation analysis
- Firebase/nodejs
- any other user input or action.

Major

- Spotify integration
    Remaining:
      - Cross-platform needed
        Background job?

- Groups
    - Only valuable once we get more users.

- Chorus playlists

- Profile
  Songs I shared
  Songs I love

Intermediary

Lowish priority 

- Share - preview song you share

High-ish priority

- Share - show existing music in there
    1. songs i liked
    2. songs i played recently
    3. playlist
    4. rest

    Search still searches apple music
    Possibly prioritize library then applemusic

# Technical debt
1. react native upgrade / port

React native rebuild
https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript

SQLification 
https://sequelize.org/v5/

AirBnb no like me research
