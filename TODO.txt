# Next
1. Specification for push notifications
    - particularly right now user engagement is a focus - can template notifications, like “{user} shared {songName} by {songArtist}”
- Love screen (track the songs you loved so you can  add to play list ? )
(loved) evolving playlist (loved)

PRIORITIZATION!!!!

Performance improvements
- Put calculation into command, not query
- Like right away... aggregate events into local storage then push?
- React optimizations improvements (ComponentWillUpdate, read logs)

Security / input validation analysis
- Firebase/nodejs
- any other user input or action.
- tracking. i literally want to look at a user in the dashboard and see everything he/she is doing.

Major

- Spotify integration
  WHY? More users to test with.
       Needs to be done at some point.

- Groups
  Only valuable once we get more users.

- Chorus playlists

- Profile
  Songs I shared
  Songs I love

Intermediary

Lowish priority 

- Share - preview song you share

Low priority

- Share - show existing music in there
    1. songs i liked
    2. songs i played recently
    3. playlist
    4. rest

    Search still searches apple music
    Possibly prioritize library then applemusic
