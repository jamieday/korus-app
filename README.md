# Korus is no longer operational 💔

Here is a little page explaining what it was about!

# What was Korus?

Korus was a music social media app for human-centric discovery.  

It was a side project / startup idea I developed in 2019. My brother Alex provided a lot of design inspo, and my brother Andrew gave killer feature suggestions.

The goal was to enable human-centred discovery, for those who believe music is best discovered and shared through friends.

It had some interesting technical components such as a bridge layer that reconciled Spotify & Apple Music. You could post on Spotify, and listen on Apple Music.

One of the more challenging items was creating the bridge layer not just in backend APIs, reconciling records, but at the mobile level as well. I needed to build a unified music SDK where you could call player.play(songId) and it would trigger the appropriate underlying APIs in Spotify or Apple Music for both iOS and Android. To post songs, I needed a unified SDK for things like "recently played" or "liked songs". Liking a song itself would also add the song to a "Korus - Liked" playlist on both music platforms. I used React Native (without Expo, originally).
